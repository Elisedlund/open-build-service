Project <%= @project.name %> is locked!

Project has been automatically locked to avoid unnecessary rebuilds of inactive projects. You are receiving this email, because you are project maintainer.

You can unlock project from webui:
<%= url_for( controller: 'webui/project',
  action: :show,
  host: @host,
  :project => @project.name) %>

or from command line:
osc unlock <%= @project.name %>

You can remove 'AutoLock' attribute from project attributes in order prevent project being autolocked again:
<%= url_for(
  controller: 'webui/attribute',
  action: :index,
  host: @host,
  :project => @project.name) %>
